    "ph - PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid–base balance of water. It is also the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52–6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardness - Hardness is a measure of the physical properties of the water. It is a measure of the ability of the water to support the roots and the leaves. The lower the hardness, the more support the roots and leaves can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS) - TDS is a measure of the solids in the water. The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chloramines - Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sulfate - Sulfate is a common disinfectant used in public water systems. Sulfate levels up to 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 2 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conductivity - Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceeded 400 μS/cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic_carbon - Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trihalomethanes - THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbidity - Turbidity is a measure of the water’s ability to absorb particulate matter. The lower the turbidity, the more it can absorb particulate matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potability (Target variable) - Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.\n"
